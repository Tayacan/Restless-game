...is a small game I'm working on, in part because I wanted to make something in pygame again, but also because it's a game idea I've had in my head for a while, and I thought it would be fun to make, regardless of the language or library.

In short, the game is about a ball which never stops bouncing. The player can't control the bouncing, only the horizontal movement. Various objects in the world will affect how the ball bounces, and the player then has to overcome obstacles using these.
